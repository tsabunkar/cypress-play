# Cypress

- Cypress is a FRONT-END testing tool built for the modern web.
- Cypress is most often compared to Selenium; however Cypress is both fundamentally and architecturally different.
- Cypress is not constrained by the same restrictions as Selenium
- Cypress enables you to write all types of tests:
  - End-to-end tests
  - Integration tests
  - Unit tests
- Features
  - Time Travel
  - Debuggability
  - Automatic Waiting (No more async hell. or no need to add waits or sleeps)
  - Spies, Stubs, and Clocks
  - Network Traffic Control
  - Consistent Results: Our architecture doesnâ€™t use Selenium or WebDriver.
  - Screenshots and Videos
  - Cross browser Testing
